# # Lab 7: IV.1 Polynomial Interpolation and Regression and IV.2 Differential Equations

# We  explore polynomial interpolation and regression, and see that when
# interpolating at an evenly spaced grid one can encounter issues with convergence.
# This is overcome via regression, but we are left with the question of how to
# solve the underlying least squares problems. 

# We also explore the reduction of differential equations to
# banded linear systems via divided differences. When we get lower bidiagonal systems these can be solved
# using forward substitution, whereas we will discuss the tridiagonal case later.

# **Learning Outcomes**
#
# Mathematical knowledge:

# 1. Vandermonde matrices and least squares.
# 2. Constructing interpolatory quadrature rules.
# 2. Issues with interpolation at evenly spaced points with functions with small radii of convergence.
# 3. Reduction of differential equations to bidiagonal or tridiagonal linear systems.
# 4. Two-point boundary value problems and their convergence rates.

# Coding knowledge:

# 1. The error function `erfi` as provided by SpecialFunctions.jl.


# We first load  packages we need including a couple new ones:


## LinearAlgebra contains routines for doing linear algebra
using LinearAlgebra, Plots, Test


# **Remark** One should normally not need to implement methods for solving differential equations
# oneself as there are packages available, including the high-performance
#  Julia package  [DifferentialEquations.jl](https://github.com/SciML/DifferentialEquations.jl). Moreover Forward and Backward
# Euler are only the first baby steps to a wide range of time-steppers, with Runge–Kutta being
# one of the most successful.
# For example, in practice we can solve
# a simple differential equation like a pendulum $u'' = -\sin u$ can be solved
# as follows (writing at a system $u' = v, v' = -\sin u$):

using DifferentialEquations, LinearAlgebra, Plots

u = solve(ODEProblem((u,_,x) -> [u[2], -sin(u[1])], [1,0], (0,10)))
plot(u)

# However, even in these automated packages one has a choice of different methods with
# different behaviour, so it is important to understand on a mathematical level what is happening under the hood.




# ## IV.1 Polynomial Interpolation and Regression

# We now explore the practical usage of polynomial interpolation and regression.
# In particular we will see that polynomial interpolation may fail as the number
# of points becomes large. 

# ### IV.1.1 Polynomial Interpolation

# A quick-and-dirty way to to do interpolation is to invert the Vandermonde matrix.
# That is, for
# $$
# p(x) = ∑_{k = 0}^{n-1} c_k x^k
# $$
# and $x_1, …, x_n ∈ ℝ$, we choose $c_k$ so that $p(x_j) = f(x_j)$ for
# $j = 1, …, n$. We do so by creating the square Vandermonde matrix 
# $$
# V := \begin{bmatrix} 1 & x_1 & ⋯ & x_1^{n-1} \\
#                     ⋮ & ⋮ & ⋱ & ⋮ \\
#                     1 & x_n & ⋯ & x_n^{n-1}
#                     \end{bmatrix}.
# $$
# If the function samples are
# $$
#  𝐟 = \begin{bmatrix} f(x_1) \\ ⋮ \\ f(x_n) \end{bmatrix}
# $$
# then the coefficients of the interpolatory polynomial
# $$
#       𝐜 = \begin{bmatrix}
#           c_0 \\ ⋮ \\ c_{n-1} \end{bmatrix} 
# $$
# must satisfy $V 𝐜 = 𝐟$.  Thus inverting the Vandermonde matrix tells us the coefficients.

# Here we see an example of this using `n` evenly spaced points:

f = x -> cos(10x)
n = 5
𝐱 = range(0, 1; length=n) # evenly spaced points (BAD for interpolation)
V =  [𝐱[j]^k for j = 1:n, k = 0:n-1] # Vandermonde matrix, also can be written as x .^ (0:n)'
𝐟 = f.(𝐱) # evaluate f at x[k], equivalent to [f(x[k]) for k = 1:n]
𝐜 = V \ 𝐟 # invert the Vandermonde matrix and determine the coefficients
p = x -> dot(𝐜, x .^ (0:n-1)) # take a dot product with monomials x .^ 0:n-1 == [x^j for j=0:n-1]
@test p.(𝐱) ≈ V * 𝐜 # evaluating the polynomial on x is the same as applying V


𝐠 = range(0,1; length=1000) # plotting grid, sample a lot more than interpolation points

## To evaluate a polynomial on the plotting grid its faster to create the rectangular Vandermonde matrix associated with that grid:
V_g = [𝐠[j]^k for j = 1:length(𝐠), k = 0:n-1]

plot(𝐠, f.(𝐠); label="function")
plot!(𝐠, V_g*𝐜; label="interpolation")
scatter!(𝐱, f.(𝐱); label="samples")


# Whether an interpolation is actually close to a function is a subtle question,
# involving properties of the function, distribution of the sample points $x_1,…,x_n$,
# and round-off error.
# A classic example is:
# $$
#   f_M(x) = {1 \over M x^2 + 1}
# $$
# where the choice of $M$ can dictate whether interpolation at evenly spaced points converges.

# -------

# **Problem 1** Interpolate $1/(4x^2+1)$ and $1/(25x^2 + 1)$ at an evenly spaced grid of $n$
# points, plotting the solution at a grid of $1000$ points. For $n = 50$ does your interpolation match
# the true function?  Does increasing $n$ to 400 improve the accuracy? How about using `BigFloat`?
# Hint: make sure to make your `range` be `BigFloat` valued, e.g., `range(big(-1), big(1); length=n)`.

## TODO: interpolate 1/(10x^2 + 1) and 1/(25x^2 + 1) at $n$ evenly spaced points, plotting both solutions evaluated at
## the plotting grid with 1000 points, for $n = 50$ and $400$.


# ------

# ### IV.1.2 Interpolatory quadrature rules

# An interpolatory quadrature rule consists of interpolating samples of a function and integrating
# the polynomial exactly. In the notes we constructed such rules by integrating the Lagrange basis,
# however, we can also compute the interpolatory polynomial by inverting the Vandermonde matrix.
# Here we explore this construction.

# **Problem 2(a)** Complete the following function that computes an interpolatory quadrature
# $$
# \int_0^1 f(x) {\rm d}x ≈ \int_0^1 p(x) {\rm d}x
# $$
# where $p(x)$ interpolates the data $𝐟 = [f_1,…,f_n]$ (given as a vector) at the given points $𝐱 = [x_1,…,x_n]$ (given as a vector).
# Hint: it is much easier to solve a linear system involving the Vandermonde matrix than to use a Lagrange basis.

function interpolatoryquadrature(f::AbstractVector, x::AbstractVector)
    if length(f) ≠ length(x)
        error("lengths must match")
    end
    ## TODO: Compute the coefficients of the interpolatory polynomial and integrate it exactly.
    
end

x = range(0, 1, 10)
@test interpolatoryquadrature(exp.(x), x) ≈ exp(1)-1

# **Problem 2(b)**  Plot the error for the number of evenly spaced points $n = 2, 3, …, 100$ for approximating the integrals
# $$
# ∫_0^1 \exp x {\rm d}x  = ℯ - 1, ∫_0^1 {{\rm d} x \over 25x^2 + 1} = {\rm arctan}(5)/5.
# $$
# How does the convergence behaviour compare with the Trapezium rule? Does the approximation appear to be stable?
# Does using `BigFloat` improve the results? (Hint: `range(0,big(1),n)` will make a sequence of `BigFloat` points.)

nanabs(x) = x == 0 ? NaN : abs(x)
## TODO: plot the errors for 2,…,100 evenly spaced points for approximating the integral of exp(x) and 1/(25x^2+1)



# **Problem 2(c)** Repeat the previous problem with the points $x_j = (\cos θ_j + 1)/2$ where $θ_j$ are $n$ evenly spaced points
# between $0$ and $π$. How do the results compare with evenly spaced points?


## TODO: plot the errors for 2,…,100 points that are cosines of evenly spaced points, shifted/scaled to be between 0 and 1.


# **Problem 3** Typically it's more convenient to compute the quadrature weights $w_j$ so that
# $$
# \int_0^1 f(x) {\rm d}x ≈ \int_0^1 p(x) {\rm d}x = ∑_{j=1}^n w_j f(x_j).
# $$
# Compute these weights by solving a linear system involving the transpose of the Vandermonde  matrix.

function interpolatoryweights(x::AbstractVector)
    ## TODO: Construct the interpolatory quadrature weights as a vector by solving a linear system involving V'
    
end

## We test on the example from the notes:
@test interpolatoryweights([0,1/4,1]) ≈ [-1/6, 8/9, 5/18]


# ------

# ### IV.1.3 Polynomial regression

# To overcome issues with interpolation we will instead use regression: use more points than
# the degree of the polynomial. As an example, suppose we want to fit noisy data by a quadratic
# $$
# p(x) = c₀ + c₁ x + c₂ x^2.
# $$
# That is, we want to choose $c₀,c₁,c₂$ at data samples $x_1, …, x_m$ so that the following is true:
# $$
# c₀ + c₁ x_j + c₂ x_j^2 ≈ f_j
# $$
# where $f_j$ are given by data. We can reinterpret this as a least squares problem: minimise the norm
# $$
# \left\| \begin{bmatrix} 1 & x_1 & x_1^2 \\ ⋮ & ⋮ & ⋮ \\ 1 & x_m & x_m^2 \end{bmatrix}
# \begin{bmatrix} p₀ \\ p₁ \\ p₂ \end{bmatrix} - \begin{bmatrix} f_1 \\ ⋮ \\ f_m \end{bmatrix} \right \|
# $$
# When a matrix is rectangular `\` solves a least squares problem for us:

m,n = 100,3

𝐱 = range(0,1; length=m) # 100 points
𝐟 = 2 .+ 𝐱 .+ 2𝐱.^2 .+ 0.1 .* randn.() # Noisy quadratic samples, built with broadcast notation.

V = 𝐱 .^ (0:2)'  # 100 x 3 Vandermonde matrix, equivalent to [ones(m) x x.^2]

𝐜 = V \ 𝐟 # coefficients are, very roughly, [2,1,2]

# We can visualise the fit:

𝐠 =range(0, 1; length=1000)

p = x -> 𝐜[1] + 𝐜[2]x + 𝐜[3]x^2

scatter(𝐱, 𝐟; label="samples", legend=:bottomright)
plot!(𝐠, p.(𝐠); label="quadratic")

# -----

# **Problem 4** Repeat  Problem 1 but now using _least squares_: instead of interpolating,
# use least squares on a large grid: choose the coefficients of a degree $(n-1)$ polynomial so that
# $$
#     \left\| \begin{bmatrix} p(x_1) \\ ⋮ \\ p(x_m) \end{bmatrix} - \begin{bmatrix} f(x_1) \\ ⋮ \\ f(x_m) \end{bmatrix} \right \|.
# $$
# is minimised, where $n = 50$ and $m = 500$. 
# Does this improve the accuracy near the endpoints? Do you think convergence for a least squares approximation
# is dictated by the radius of convergence of the corresponding Taylor series?
# Hint: use the rectangular Vandermonde matrix to setup the Least squares system. The solution will look extremely similar to Problem 1.

## TODO: approximate 1/(10x^2 + 1) and 1/(25x^2 + 1) using a least squares system.

# ## IV.2 Differential Equations via Finite Differences

# We now turn to an important application of banded linear algebra:
# approximating solutions to linear differential equations. We will focus on first and second order
# but the techniques generalise beyond this, to vector problems, nonlinear differential equations, and partial differential equations.
# In particular we explore _finite difference_ approximations which use divided differences to replace derivatives.
# These are the most basic type of numerical method and many powerful alternatives
# exist, including Finite Element Methods and spectral methods.


# ### IV.2.1 Indefinite integration

# We can use the right-sided divided difference to approximate derivatives.  Let's do an example of integrating $\cos x$ by discretising the ODE
# $$
#  u(0) = c, \qquad u'(x) = f(x)
# $$
# and see if our method matches
# the true answer of $\sin x$. Recall from the notes that this equation can be approximated by $u_k$ solving the bidiagonal linear system
# $$
# \begin{bmatrix}
#     1 \\
#     -1/h & 1/h \\
#     & ⋱ & ⋱ \\
#     && -1/h & 1/h \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}u_0\\u_1\\⋮\\u_n\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}c\\ f(x_0)\\ ⋮ \\ f(x_{n-1})\end{bmatrix}.
# $$
# We can construct the bidiagonal matrix as follows:

n = 10
x = range(0, 1; length=n+1) # makes an n+1 point evenly spaced grid
h = step(x) # equivalent to 1/n
L = Bidiagonal([1; fill(1/h, n)], fill(-1/h, n), :L)

# We can use this bidiagonal matrix along with `\` to solve the
# system via forward substitution:

c = 0 # u(0) = 0
f = x -> cos(x)

𝐟 = f.(x[1:end-1]) # evaluate f at all but the last point
𝐛 = [c; 𝐟]
𝐮 = L \ 𝐛 # integrate using forward-differences

plot(x, sin.(x); label="sin(x)", legend=:bottomright)
scatter!(x, 𝐮; label="forward")


#  We can estimate how fast it converges by measuring
# the ∞-norm error (using $\| 𝐱 \|_∞ := \max |x_k|$ which
# is implemented as `norm(x,Inf)`):

## Error from indefinite integration with c and f
function forward_err(u, c, f, n)
    x = range(0, 1; length = n+1)
    h = step(x) # equivalent to 1/n
    L = Bidiagonal([1; fill(1/h, n)], fill(-1/h, n), :L)
    𝐮 = L\ [c; f.(x[1:end-1])]
    errs = 𝐮 - u.(x) # compare numerics with "true" result
    norm(errs, Inf) # measure ∞-norm error
end


ns = 10 .^ (1:8) # solve up to n = 10 million
scatter(ns, forward_err.(sin, 0, f, ns); xscale=:log10, yscale=:log10, label="forward")
plot!(ns, ns .^ (-1); label="1/n", linestyle=:dash)

# We see that the method converges linearly (like $O(n^{-1})$).

# ------

# **Problem 5(a)** In the problem sheet we derived Backward Euler using the left-sided divided difference
# $$
#   u'(x) ≈ {u(x) - u(x-h) \over h}
# $$
# Implement Backward Euler to approximate
# indefinite-integration. How does the error compare to forward
# for $f(x) = \cos x$ on the interval $[0,1]$?
# Use the method to approximate the indefinite intergral of
# $$
# \exp(\exp x \cos x + \sin x)
# $$
# to 3 digits.

## TODO: Implement Backward Euler by constructing a lower bidiagonal linear system.


# **Problem 5(b)** Implement indefinite-integration
# where we impose the equation on the midpoints $x̃_1,…,x̃_n$ defined as
# $$
# x̃_j = {x_{j+1} + x_j \over 2} = a + (j-1/2)h
# $$
# using the central difference formula
# $$
# u'(x̃_j) ≈ {u(x_j) - u(x_{j-1}) \over h}
# $$
# By plotting the errors show that this method converges at
# a faster rate than Forward or Backward Euler for $f(x) = \cos x$ on the interval $[0,1]$.


## TODO: Discretise at midpoints rather than our grid. The solution is still approximated on the original grid.


# ----

# ### IV.2.2 Forward Euler


# We now adapt the approach for more general ODEs of the form
# $$
#   u'(x) + ω(x)u(x) = f(x), u(0) = c.
# $$
# We now have the system:
# $$
# \underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}
# 1 \\
# ω(x_0)-1/h & 1/h \\
# & ⋱ & ⋱ \\
# && ω(x_{n-1})-1/h & 1/h \end{bmatrix}}_L \underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}u_0 \\ u_1 \\ ⋮ \\ u_n\end{bmatrix} }_{𝐮} = \begin{bmatrix} c \\ f(x_0) \\ ⋮ \\ f(x_{n-1}) \end{bmatrix}
# $$
# Consider the simple example:
#  $$
#  u(0) = 1, u' + x u = {\rm e}^x
#  $$
#  which has an exact solution in terms of a special error function
#  (which I determined using Mathematica).


using SpecialFunctions
c = 1
ω = x -> x
n = 200
x = range(0, 1; length=n+1)
## exact solution, found in Mathematica
u = x -> -(1/2)*exp(-(1+x^2)/2)*(-2sqrt(ℯ) + sqrt(2π)erfi(1/sqrt(2)) - sqrt(2π)erfi((1 + x)/sqrt(2)))

h = step(x)
L = Bidiagonal([1; fill(1/h, n)], ω.(x[1:end-1]) .- 1/h, :L)

𝐛 = [c; exp.(x[1:end-1])]
𝐮 = L \ 𝐛

plot(x, u.(x); label="u(x)", legend=:bottomright)
scatter!(x, 𝐮; label="forward")

## We see that it is converging to the true result.

# **Problem  6** Implement backward Euler for solving:
# $$
# \begin{align*}
# u(0) &= 1, u'(t) - \cos(t) u(t) = t
# \end{align*}
# $$
# on the interval $[0,1]$. Approximate $u(1)$ to three digits accuracy.

## TODO: Implement backward Euler for the case with a variable coefficient.



# -----

# ### IV.2.3 Poisson equation

# We now consider the Poisson equation with Dirichlet
# boundary conditions. In particular consider a case where
# we know the true answer: if $u(x) = \cos x^2$ then it solves the ODE:
# $$
# \begin{align*}
# u(0) = \underbrace{1}_c \\
# u''(x) = \underbrace{-4x^2 \cos(x^2) - 2\sin(x^2)}_{f(x)} \\
# u(1) = \underbrace{\cos 1}_d
# \end{align*}
# $$
# We approximate it by the solution to the tridiagonal system:
# $$
# \underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}
#     1 \\
#     1/h^2 & -2/h^2 & 1/h \\
#     & ⋱ & ⋱ & ⋱ \\
#    && 1/h^2 & -2/h^2 & 1/h \\
#    &&&& 1 \end{bmatrix}}_A \underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}u_0\\u_1\\⋮\\u_n\end{bmatrix} }_{𝐮} = \underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}c\\ f(x_1)\\ f(x_2)\\ ⋮ \\ f(x_{n-1})\\ d\end{bmatrix} }_{𝐛}
# $$
# We first construct the matrix $A$ using `Tridiagonal`:
n = 20
x = range(0, 1; length = n + 1)
h = step(x)
A = Tridiagonal([fill(1/h^2, n-1); 0],
                [1; fill(-2/h^2, n-1); 1],
                [0; fill(1/h^2, n-1)])

# Thus we get an approximation to our (known) solution:

u = x -> cos(x^2)
f = x -> -4x^2*cos(x^2) - 2sin(x^2)
𝐛 =  [1; f.(x[2:end-1]); cos(1)]
